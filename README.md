Duration: One Month
Mentor:  Muzammil
OVERVIEW OF THE PROJECT:
Project:Python Programming

Objective:
1.To enable basic arithmetic operations: addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.
2.To interact with users through a simple command-line interface.
3.To validate user inputs and handle errors like division by zero.
4.To provide quick and accurate calculation results to the user.

KEY ACTIVITIES:
1.Defining the Operations: Decide on the operations your calculator will perform (e.g., addition, subtraction, multiplication, division).
2.Creating Functions: Write functions for each operation.
3.User Input: Set up the program to accept user input for numbers and operations.
4.Processing Input: Ensure the program can process the input and perform the correct operation.
5.Displaying Results: Output the result to the user.

TECHNOLOGIES USED:
For a basic calculator program in Python, the primary technology used is the Python programming language. No additional technologies are necessary for a simple console-based calculator. However, if you plan to create a graphical user interface (GUI) for your calculator, you might use a library like Tkinter.
